# heads-or-tails
This app just flips heads or tails randomly, includes all the app icons and a counter
so that the user can tell how many times the coin has flipped on either heads or tails,
and if the coin has landed on the same side.

my first iOS app, flips heads or tails and keeps count of which one it lands on
Its almost done, I need to figure out how to center things, also need to figure
out how to get things so that they don't get cut off when moving the phone into portrait
or landscape.
Also using this for version control, just incase!
